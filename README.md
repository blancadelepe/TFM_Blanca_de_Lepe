This repository aims to store the code for the analysis of the striatum palmitome from mice deficient in ZDHHC15 palmitoyl-transferase
## Script "analysis_striatal_palmitome"
The aim of this script is to analyse the striatal palmitome from mice deficient in ZDHHC15 palmitoyl-transferase and control mice to determine the palmitoylated proteins by ZDHHC15 and study the processes in which they are involved. To this end, the first part of the script focuses on the pre-processing, normalization and exploratory analysis of the data, followed by differential palmitoylation analysis using the Bioconductor "Limma" package. Finally, the differentially palmitoylated proteins are subjected to functional enrichment analysis using Bioconductor's "ClusterProfiler" package.
